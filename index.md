Spectrum 2 is not intended for strictly desktop users, ie those who have no familiarity with running server side applications.  It is intended to provide a service to desktop users, but be managed by server administrators.  If you are interested in the project but have no familiarity with running a server (and no interest in learning), please speak with your local system administrators about making Spectrum 2 available.
