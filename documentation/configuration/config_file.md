### Types of configuration fields

Following types are used:

integer - Examples: key=0

string - Examples: key=something

boolean - Examples: key=0 or key=1

list - List of strings (or Jabber IDs). You can specify this options more than once:

	allowed_servers=domain.tld
	allowed_servers=example.com

#### service.server_mode

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures if Spectrum 2 works in server mode or gateway mode
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|boolean
Default:|0

If this option is true, Spectrum 2 works in server-mode and acts as standalone server.

User then logins legacy networks by logging XMPP account like this one: `my_msn_name%hotmail.com@msn.domain.tld`.

*Advantages:*
* Passwords are not stored on server.
* Roster synchronization is easy, because Spectrum 2 acts as normal server.
* If you want to use Spectrum 2 as wrapper between different networks, you don't need database or Jabber server as another layer.
* Using SRV records you can easily run Spectrum 2 on different machines to scale it.

*Disadvantages:*

* Clients have to support more accounts to connect more legacy networks (Therefore they will need have to use more TCP connections).

If this option is false, Spectrum 2 acts as normal XMPP component (gateway).

You then have to configure an external XMPP server (like Prosody or Ejabberd) to serve the subdomain you want to use for Spectrum 2 (for example "icq.domain.tld"). Spectrum 2 in gateway mode then connects the XMPP server as its component and users are able to find out "icq.domain.tld" in Service Discovery, register it and use it.

*Advantages:*
* Users can use more legacy networks using single XMPP account (and using single TCP connection).
* It's easy to extend existing XMPP servers using gateway mode.

*Disadvantages:*
* Passwords are stored (even in encrypted form) on server.
* Roster (contact list) synchronization can be problematic, because it depends on the client user uses. This can be improved by usage of Remote Roster protoXEP.
* You have to setup XMPP server and use database even if you only want to use Spectrum 2 as a tool to connect legacy networks using XMPP protocol.


#### service.jid

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures Jabber ID of Spectrum 2 instance
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures Jabber ID of particular Spectrum 2 instance. Usually it is a hostname on which this Spectrum 2 instance
runs, so for example `icq.domain.tld`. Note that you have to have DNS records configured for this hostname, so clients will be able
to find out your Jabber server (in case you are running Spectrum 2 in gateway-mode) or the Spectrum 2 itself (if you are running
Spectrum 2 in server-mode).

#### service.server

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures hostname or IP address of server to which Spectrum 2 connects to.
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures hostname or IP address of server to which Spectrum 2 connects to. It is used only in gateway-mode and
you should configure it to point to hostname or IP of your XMPP server.

#### service.port

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

This option configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode. In server-mode
the default port for XMPP servers is 5222, so you should use this port. In gateway-mode, you have to at first configure your
server to allow Spectrum 2 to connect it as its component. On many servers, the default component port is 5347, but this option
depends on particular XMPP server and its configuration.

#### service.password

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures password to be used to connect XMPP server
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

This option configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode. In server-mode
the default port for XMPP servers is 5222, so you should use this port. In gateway-mode, you have to at first configure your
server to allow Spectrum 2 to connect it as its component. On many servers, the default component port is 5347, but this option
depends on particular XMPP server and its configuration.

#### service.cert

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures certificate to be used for SSL encryption in server-mode.
Context:|server-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures full path to PKCS#12 certificate which is used for SSL in server-mode. To find out, how to create
such certificate, please read [Using SSL in server mode](http://spectrum.im/documentation/configuration/server_ssl.html).

#### service.cert_password

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures password for certificate which is used for SSL encryption in server-mode.
Context:|server-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures password which is used to decrypt PKCS#12 certificate (if it is encrypted). For more information about SSL
with Spectrum 2, read service.cert option description.

#### service.admin_jid

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures list of Jabber IDs, which has ability to use Admin Interface.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|list of Jabber IDs
Default:|empty list

This option configures list of Jabber IDs, which has ability to use Admin Interface. In server-mode, you also have to specify
service.admin_password to set password for Admin Interface. In gatewa-mode, you just specify the list of Jabber IDs, Spectrum 2 does
not check any password in gateway-mode.

#### service.admin_password

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures password which is used by clients defined in service.admin_jid to use Admin Interface.
Context:|server-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures the password which is used by clients defined in service.admin_jid to use Admin Interface.

#### service.allowed_servers

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures list of servers from which users can connect and register Spectrum 2 transport.
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|list of JIDs
Default:|empty list

Configures list of servers from which users can connect and register Spectrum 2 transport. This option is used together with
registration.enable_public_registration option. If registration.enable_public_registration is set to 0, you can use this option
as a white-list, to enable users from particular domain to use your Spectrum 2 instance, but disallow it to any other users.
