Type:|list of JIDs
Default:|empty list

Configures list of servers from which users can connect and register Spectrum 2 transport. This option is used together with
registration.enable_public_registration option. If registration.enable_public_registration is set to 0, you can use this option
as a white-list, to enable users from particular domain to use your Spectrum 2 instance, but disallow it to any other users.

Following part of config file disables public registrations and allows only users from xmpp.org and jabber.org to use this Spectrum 2 instance:

	[service]
	allowed_servers=xmpp.org
	allowed_servers=jabber.org
	
	[registration]
	enable_public_registration=0


#### service.backend

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures path to backend executable.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures path to backend executable. When user connects, Spectrum 2 spawns new backend process to handle this user's
session. Usually single backend is shared by more users. This can be configured using service.users_per_backend.

#### service.backend_host

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures hostname or IP to which backend connects.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|localhost

This option configures hostname or IP to which backend connects. When Spectrum 2 is started, it listens on service.backend_port
to communicate with backends. When new backend is started, it connects to the hostname configured by this option and starts handling
new users sessions.

#### service.backend_port

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures port on which Spectrum 2 listens on for backends connections.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

----|----
Description:|Configures certificate to be used for SSL encryption in server-mode.
Context:|server-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures full path to PKCS#12 certificate which is used for SSL in server-mode. To find out, how to create
such certificate, please read [Using SSL in server mode](http://spectrum.im/documentation/configuration/server_ssl.html).

#### service.cert_password

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures password for certificate which is used for SSL encryption in server-mode.
Context:|server-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures password which is used to decrypt PKCS#12 certificate (if it is encrypted). For more information about SSL
with Spectrum 2, read service.cert option description.

#### service.group

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures group under which Spectrum 2 instance runs.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures name of group under which Spectrum 2 instance runs. When Spectrum 2 is started, it switches from current group
to this group.


#### service.jid

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures Jabber ID of Spectrum 2 instance
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures Jabber ID of particular Spectrum 2 instance. Usually it is a hostname on which this Spectrum 2 instance
runs, so for example `icq.domain.tld`. Note that you have to have DNS records configured for this hostname, so clients will be able
to find out your Jabber server (in case you are running Spectrum 2 in gateway-mode) or the Spectrum 2 itself (if you are running
Spectrum 2 in server-mode).

#### service.password

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures password to be used to connect XMPP server
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

This option configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode. In server-mode
the default port for XMPP servers is 5222, so you should use this port. In gateway-mode, you have to at first configure your
server to allow Spectrum 2 to connect it as its component. On many servers, the default component port is 5347, but this option
depends on particular XMPP server and its configuration.

#### service.pidfile

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures path to file when Spectrum 2 stores its process ID.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|/var/run/spectrum2/$jid.pid

This option configures path to file when Spectrum 2 stores its process ID. This file is later used by `spectrum2_manager` to determine,
if this particular Spectrum 2 instance runs.

#### service.port

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|0

This option configures port on which Spectrum listens to in server-mode or to which connects in gateway-mode. In server-mode
the default port for XMPP servers is 5222, so you should use this port. In gateway-mode, you have to at first configure your
server to allow Spectrum 2 to connect it as its component. On many servers, the default component port is 5347, but this option
depends on particular XMPP server and its configuration.

#### service.server

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures hostname or IP address of server to which Spectrum 2 connects to.
Context:|gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures hostname or IP address of server to which Spectrum 2 connects to. It is used only in gateway-mode and
you should configure it to point to hostname or IP of your XMPP server.

#### service.server_mode

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures if Spectrum 2 works in server mode or gateway mode
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|boolean
Default:|0

If this option is true, Spectrum 2 works in server-mode and acts as standalone server.

User then logins legacy networks by logging XMPP account like this one: `my_msn_name%hotmail.com@msn.domain.tld`.

*Advantages:*
* Passwords are not stored on server.
* Roster synchronization is easy, because Spectrum 2 acts as normal server.
* If you want to use Spectrum 2 as wrapper between different networks, you don't need database or Jabber server as another layer.
* Using SRV records you can easily run Spectrum 2 on different machines to scale it.

*Disadvantages:*

* Clients have to support more accounts to connect more legacy networks (Therefore they will need have to use more TCP connections).

If this option is false, Spectrum 2 acts as normal XMPP component (gateway).

You then have to configure an external XMPP server (like Prosody or Ejabberd) to serve the subdomain you want to use for Spectrum 2 (for example "icq.domain.tld"). Spectrum 2 in gateway mode then connects the XMPP server as its component and users are able to find out "icq.domain.tld" in Service Discovery, register it and use it.

*Advantages:*
* Users can use more legacy networks using single XMPP account (and using single TCP connection).
* It's easy to extend existing XMPP servers using gateway mode.

*Disadvantages:*
* Passwords are stored (even in encrypted form) on server.
* Roster (contact list) synchronization can be problematic, because it depends on the client user uses. This can be improved by usage of Remote Roster protoXEP.
* You have to setup XMPP server and use database even if you only want to use Spectrum 2 as a tool to connect legacy networks using XMPP protocol.




#### service.user

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures user under which Spectrum 2 instance runs.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|empty string

This option configures name of user under which Spectrum 2 instance runs. When Spectrum 2 is started, it switches from current user
(usually root) to this user.


#### service.users_per_backend

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures maximum number of users who share single backend process.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|integer
Default:|100

This option configures maximum number of users who share single backend process. Value of this option depends on number of online
users on your Spectrum 2 instance in the same time. There is no strict consensus on what is the best value. Every backend is separated
process and you probably want to keep the number of processes per Spectrum 2 instance less than 30. So if you have 1000 users, it
could be sane to use `users_per_backend=50`. Another idea is to have the same number of backends as the number of CPU cores of the
machine where Spectrum 2 is running.

If you have too big value of users_per_backend, you have just single backend process for all users and Spectrum 2 will not perform so well
as if you have more backends running for the same user-base. Also, if there is some problem with single backend, it will affects only users
connected using this particular backend, so it is good idea to have more backends running. However, the more backends you have
the more processes the machine has and since some point, it will become less useful. There is also some memory overhead, so if you run
500 users on single backend, it will take little bit less memory than 500 users on 5 backends (but it is not significant unless you decide
to have hundreds of backends).

If you presume to have just few users on your personal server, it can be useful to configure `service.users_per_backend=1`. Ever user will
get his own separated backend process.

For bigger user-base, you have to increase the `service.users_per_backend` value, but there is no optimal value to be suggested yet.


#### service.working_dir

Key | val
----|----
Description:|Configures path to directory when Spectrum 2 stores its data files.
Context:|server-mode and gateway-mode
Type:|string
Default:|/var/lib/spectrum2/$jid

This option configures path to directory when Spectrum 2 stores its data files like for example SQLite3 database.
